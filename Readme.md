This is (going to be) the Reddit-like app built while working through the book [Discover Meteor](https://www.discovermeteor.com).

Contrary to their choices (Javascript, plain HTML, raw CSS, Bootstrap), I'm starting with different tools, because they are (close to) what I'm used to from the Ruby on Rails world.


* CoffeeScript to replace the raw JavaScript
* Jade as a templating language. It's close to [Slim](http://slim-lang.com/)
* Zurb Foundation for Sites to replace Bootstrap
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), because raw CSS is just too verbose.
